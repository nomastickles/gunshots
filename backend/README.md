## Installation/deployment instructions

Depending on your preferred package manager, follow the instructions below to deploy your project.

> If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the same Node version in local and in your lambda's runtime.

### Project structure

The project code base is mainly located within the `src` folder. This folder is divided in:

- `functions` - containing code base and configuration for your lambda functions
- `libs` - containing shared code base between your lambdas

```
.
├── src
│   ├── functions            # Lambda configuration and source code folder
│   │   └── hello
│   │       └── handler.ts   # `Hello` lambda source code
│   │
│   └── libs                 # Lambda shared code
│       └── apiGateway.ts    # API Gateway specific helpers
│
├── package.json
├── serverless.ts            # Serverless service file
├── tsconfig.json            # Typescript compiler configuration
└── webpack.config.js        # Webpack configuration
```

### 3rd party librairies

- [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) - middleware engine for Node.Js lambda. This template uses [http-json-body-parser](https://github.com/middyjs/middy/tree/master/packages/http-json-body-parser) to convert API Gateway `event.body` property, originally passed as a stringified JSON, to its corresponding parsed object
- [@serverless/typescript](https://github.com/serverless/typescript) - provides up-to-date TypeScript definitions for your `serverless.ts` service file
