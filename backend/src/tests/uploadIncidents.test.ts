 * mock the incidents coming in from @lib level

 * be able to copy and paste csv examples

 * this will be just an example testing the heart of the thing.
 * (maybe frontend could test the 'url' hiding bit)
 *
 *
 * the idea is:
 * hey there's a lot of ways people are tackling serverless testing
 *
 * question is: with the small time you have what do you want to test?
 *
 * this is not a business that we're running here this is an art project
 * SO I just want to focus on the business logic so make sure we don't
 * go out to google more than we need. everything else for this project
 * we can run local invokes and make sure things are good. If this was a
 * real business project then I would flesh this out more for whatever
 * architecture that business project would entail, which could include
 * rate limiting certain processes etc.
